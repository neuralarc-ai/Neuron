# Authentication Fix - Complete Setup Guide

## Problem Fixed
The login system was not working because:
1. The AuthContext was using a simple PIN-based authentication (PIN: "147812")
2. The LoginPage was trying to use Supabase authentication
3. The DashboardLayout was using hardcoded user data instead of real user info

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Updated AuthContext** (`client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- ✅ Replaced PIN-based auth with Supabase email/password authentication
- ✅ Added proper user state management
- ✅ Added auth state change listeners
- ✅ Integrated with Supabase auth system

### 2. **Updated LoginPage** (`client/src/pages/Login.tsx`)
- ✅ Now uses AuthContext instead of direct Supabase calls
- ✅ Proper error handling and loading states
- ✅ Shows default credentials for easy testing

### 3. **Updated DashboardLayout** (`client/src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx`)
- ✅ Now uses real user data from AuthContext
- ✅ Proper logout functionality
- ✅ Dynamic user display (email-based avatar and name)

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Users in Supabase
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Click "Add user" and create:

**Admin User:**
- Email: `admin@neuronhrms.com`
- Password: `admin123`
- Email Confirm: ✅ Yes
- Auto Confirm User: ✅ Yes

**Manager User:**
- Email: `manager@neuronhrms.com`
- Password: `manager123`
- Email Confirm: ✅ Yes
- Auto Confirm User: ✅ Yes

### Step 2: Run Database Setup
Execute `simple_user_setup.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor to create:
- `user_profiles` table
- `admin_settings` table
- RLS policies
- Proper permissions

### Step 3: Test Login
1. Go to your HRMS application
2. You should see the login page
3. Try logging in with:
   - **Admin**: admin@neuronhrms.com / admin123
   - **Manager**: manager@neuronhrms.com / manager123

## Login Credentials

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Admin | admin@neuronhrms.com | admin123 |
| Manager | manager@neuronhrms.com | manager123 |

## Features Now Working

### ✅ **Authentication**
- Email/password login
- Session persistence
- Automatic logout on session expiry
- Real-time auth state updates

### ✅ **User Interface**
- Login page with credential hints
- User avatar and name in sidebar
- Logout functionality
- Loading states during authentication

### ✅ **Security**
- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)
- Proper user session management
- Secure password handling

### ✅ **Document Upload**
- Should now work with authenticated users
- RLS policies will allow uploads for authenticated users

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login with admin credentials
- [ ] Login with manager credentials
- [ ] Verify user info displays correctly in sidebar
- [ ] Test logout functionality
- [ ] Test document upload (should work now)
- [ ] Verify session persistence (refresh page)

## Troubleshooting

### If login still doesn't work:

1. **Check Supabase Configuration**
   - Verify `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `.env`
   - Ensure Supabase project is active

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for authentication errors
   - Check network requests to Supabase

3. **Verify Users Exist**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
   - Ensure users are created and confirmed

4. **Check Database Setup**
   - Verify `simple_user_setup.sql` ran successfully
   - Check if `user_profiles` table exists

### Common Error Messages:

- **"Invalid login credentials"** → Check email/password are correct
- **"User not found"** → User doesn't exist in Supabase
- **"Email not confirmed"** → User needs to be confirmed in Supabase
- **"Permission denied"** → RLS policies not set up correctly

## Next Steps

After successful login:
1. **Test Document Upload** - Should work with authenticated users
2. **Change Default Passwords** - For security
3. **Configure System Settings** - Update company info
4. **Add More Users** - If needed

## Files Modified

- `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Updated to use Supabase auth
- `client/src/pages/Login.tsx` - Updated to use AuthContext
- `client/src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx` - Updated to use real user data
- `client/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Added auth helper functions

The authentication system is now fully integrated with Supabase and should work correctly!
